# 🗺️ Project Roadmap

This document outlines the future development plans for JRock's Personal AI, focusing on expanding data integration and pipeline capabilities.

## 🔗 Data Integration Pipelines

The goal is to ingest and process a wider variety of personal data to build a more comprehensive digital twin.

### ⚖️ Legal Data
- [ ] **Legal Document Ingestion**: Create pipelines to ingest contracts, wills, and other legal documents.
- [ ] **Clause Extraction**: Implement logic to extract and index key clauses and entities from legal texts.
- [ ] **Conflict Detection**: (Future) Analyze documents for potential conflicts or obligations.

### 📱 Social Media Data
- [ ] **Twitter/X Archive Import**: pipelines to ingest tweet archives and interactions.
- [ ] **LinkedIn Data Sync**: Ingest professional history, posts, and network data.
- [ ] **Facebook/Instagram Archive**: Process downloaded archive data for timeline reconstruction.
- [ ] **Discord/Messaging Logs**: (Privacy focused) Ingest chat logs for linguistic pattern matching.

### 💬 Chat & Interaction History
- [ ] **LLM Chat export**: Build repeatable workflow retrieval pipelines for historical chat data (Gemini, ChatGPT, Claude, etc.).
- [ ] **IDE Chat Integration**: Ingest "this chat" (Vibe Coding/Cursor history) for project context awareness.


### 📢 Advertising & Behavioral Data
- [ ] **Ad Preference Analysis**: Ingest Google/Facebook ad interest data to understand the "digital mirror".
- [ ] **Browsing History Integration**: (Local only) Analyze browsing patterns for interest clustering.
- [ ] **Purchase History**: Ingest Amazon/receipt data for lifestyle analysis.

### 🧬 Other Personal Datasets
- [ ] **Health & Fitness**: Integration with Apple Health/Fitbit exports.
- [ ] **Financial Data**: (Secure/Local) Categorized transaction history for financial behavior modeling.
- [ ] **Location History**: Map visualization and semantic location tagging.

### 🛡️ Cyber Security & Meta-Intelligence
- [ ] **Surveillance Pattern Recognition**: Add meta-intelligence layer to identify network signal patterns (noise vs. relevant activity).
- [ ] **Resilience Monitoring**: "Consciousness" checks for system integrity and intrusion detection.
- [ ] **Multi-Model Intelligence**: Router to select optimal models (Gemini, Claude, Llama) based on task complexity/cost.


### 🌳 Genealogy & Ancestry
- [ ] **Ancestry Integration**: Ingest family tree data (GEDCOM, Ancestry.com exports) to map lineage and connections.
- [ ] **Genetic Data Analysis**: (Secure/Local) Process raw DNA data for health and trait insights.
